      <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In the summer of 1812, Napoleon Bonaparte led the Grand Army — over 422,000 soldiers — eastward into Russia. 
        The campaign began with confidence, but it ended as one of history’s most devastating military disasters. 
        Only a small fraction of the soldiers who crossed the Neman River ever made it home.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1869, French civil engineer <strong>Charles Joseph Minard</strong> visualized this story not with words, 
        but with data. His flow map combined geography, troop size, and temperature — 
        a groundbreaking example of how visualization can convey human tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This recreation revisits Minard’s design through modern tools, integrating interactivity, animation, 
        and 3D visualization to provide both analytical depth and emotional storytelling.
      </p>

      <h2>The Grand Army’s Journey</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Flow Map</strong> below represents the movement of Napoleon’s troops from the Neman River 
        to Moscow and back. The tan bands show the army’s advance; the dark bands illustrate the retreat. 
        Each line’s width is proportional to the number of surviving soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This map captures the essence of Minard’s genius: a single chart combining 
        <em>geography</em>, <em>time</em>, <em>temperature</em>, and <em>human loss</em>. 
        With each kilometer forward, men perished not only from battle but from exhaustion, hunger, and the Russian winter.

      <h2>The Deadly Cold</h2>
      <p>
        As the army retreated, temperatures plummeted below freezing. 
        The chart below shows the recorded temperatures along the retreat route. 
        The deeper the army went into Russia, the colder it became — reaching <strong>-30°C</strong> at its worst.
      </p>
      <p>
        By visually aligning geography and temperature, this graph demonstrates how 
        environmental factors were as deadly as enemy combat. 
        The soldiers were not only fighting the Russians — they were fighting nature itself.

      <h2>Survivors Over Time</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Survivor Trend</strong> visualization quantifies the devastating attrition 
        across the journey. From 422,000 men departing the Neman River, fewer than 10,000 reached the border again. 
        The exponential decline is not just a statistic — it’s a representation of human endurance and collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every narrowing band and shrinking number stands as a reminder of how information design 
        can humanize data — showing not only “how much” was lost, but “when” and “why”.

      <h2>3D Mortality Ribbon</h2>
      <p>
        This <strong>3D Ribbon Visualization</strong> expands Minard’s flat design into space, 
        showing troop decline as an elevation that falls with distance and temperature. 
        The visualization provides an abstract but emotional landscape — the terrain of survival itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through height, depth, and color, we perceive loss as a gradual descent into emptiness, 
        echoing the soldiers’ march through the frozen Russian expanse.

      <h2>Animated March</h2>
      <p>
        Animation allows us to <strong>feel time</strong>. 
        As you watch the army advance and retreat in this animated sequence, 
        you can sense the steady collapse of strength and morale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each frame reflects the shrinking hope of the Grand Army — what began as a march of conquest 
        ends as a slow retreat of survival.

      <h2>Interactive Data Dashboard</h2>
      <p>
        This dashboard brings together the geographical, thermal, and survival data into a single interactive hub.
        Users can explore relationships across variables — seeing firsthand how geography and temperature 
        intertwined with mortality.
